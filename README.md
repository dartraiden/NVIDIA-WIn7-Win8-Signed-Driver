# Signed NVIDIA driver for Windows 7 â€” 8.1
Starting January 16th 2023, Microsoft is no longer accepting driver submissions for WHQL certification on Windows 7. To install and use the driver, NVIDIA [recommends](https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5445/~/changes-to-the-display-driver-installation-process-under-microsoft-windows-7) enabling test mode. I suggest another method that does not require disabling the Windows security mechanisms.

## Usage
1. Download patched files from [releases](https://github.com/dartraiden/NVIDIA-WIn7-Win8-Signed-Driver/releases) (you can find an archive of previous versions [here](https://cloud.mail.ru/public/9dLW/ybiKN6ev5)).
2. Download the official driver package from the NVIDIA website.
3. Unpack the official driver package with 7-Zip / WinRAR / etc.
4. Replace original files with patched ones.
5. Run setup.exe.
